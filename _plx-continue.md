# ▶️ Continue Plan

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to realign with your original plan and continue executing the established todo list.

## 1. Review Original Plan
[ ] Review your todo list and requirements to confirm current position.

Examine [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) for active tasks and priorities, then check [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) to verify alignment with core objectives and success criteria. This establishes a clear picture of progress and next steps.

## 2. Verify Context
[ ] Check memory file and validate alignment with original plan.

Review [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) to understand latest decisions and current state, comparing against the original plan to identify any drift or needed adjustments. This ensures you stay on track with intended direction.

## 3. Confirm Next Steps
[ ] Identify and validate the next task in sequence.

Check that all prerequisites and dependencies are met for the next planned task, reviewing [the-development-process.md](the-development-process.md) to confirm proper methodology. This prepares you for successful continuation.

## 4. Execute Ready Check
[ ] Verify all requirements are met before proceeding.

Confirm that requirements are aligned, processes are clear, necessary resources are available, and the path forward is unblocked. This final check ensures you're fully prepared to continue execution.

Remember: Stay focused on the original plan. If significant changes are needed, use `plx-focus` instead to reevaluate.
