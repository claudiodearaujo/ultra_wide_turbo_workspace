# ðŸ”„ The Refinement Process

This document guides you through the refinement process - a structured approach to ensure your requirements are well-defined in [your-requirements](your-requirements.md).

# ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. **Choose Your Starting Point**
   1. User-focused (Actors)
   2. Feature-focused (Activities)
   3. Data-focused (Properties)
   4. Rules-focused (Behaviors)

2. **For Each Item You Add:**
   1. Link it to related items using [[square brackets]]
   2. Define its properties
   3. Define its behaviors
   4. Create implementation todos

3. **Complete Item Checklist**
   1. Item is fully implemented
   2. All sub-items are implemented
   3. All relationships are connected
   4. All required tests are passing

> Note: Only check off a parent item when ALL its children are complete.

# ðŸ”— Relationship Guide

## Core Relationships
1. Actor â†’ performs â†’ Activity
2. Component â†’ supports â†’ Activity
3. Activity â†’ uses â†’ Component
4. Activity â†’ has â†’ Properties
5. Activity â†’ follows â†’ Behaviour
6. Component â†’ has â†’ Properties
7. Component â†’ follows â†’ Behaviour
8. Property â†’ has â†’ Behaviour

## Mapping Process
1. Start with any item
2. Ask these questions:
   1. What uses this?
   2. What does this use?
   3. What properties does it have?
   4. What behaviours does it follow?
   5. What activities is it involved in?

## Example Relationships
1. [[User]] performs [[Create Post]]
2. [[Create Post]] uses [[Post Editor]]
3. [[Post Editor]] has [[character limit]]
4. [[character limit]] follows [[Show warning when exceeded]]

## Validation Checklist
1. All items use double [[square brackets]] for relationships
2. All items have defined relationships
3. All items have associated todos
4. No orphaned items exist
