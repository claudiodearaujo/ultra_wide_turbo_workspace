# ðŸš€ Start New Task

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to properly initiate and structure a new task or project by setting up documentation, analyzing requirements, and creating a clear plan.

## 1. Set Up Documentation
[ ] Create memory entry and document initial resources.

Review any initial input, create a timestamped entry in [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) documenting the task description, constraints, and context. Add relevant documentation and references to [your-resources.md](your-resources.md).

## 2. Analyze Requirements
[ ] Document and validate all requirements.

Document requirements in [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) by listing actors, components, activities, properties and behaviors. Validate completeness, clarity, dependencies and risks against the initial input.

## 3. Create Action Plan
[ ] Build milestone-based todo list with clear tasks.

Create a structured todo list in [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) with clear milestones and specific tasks, ensuring each milestone includes tests. Review relevant process documents to inform the implementation approach.

## 4. Communicate and Verify
[ ] Present plan and verify readiness to proceed.

Present initial plan with key milestones and uncertainties, document any feedback received, and verify that all documentation is complete and understanding is clear before proceeding with implementation.

Remember: A well-structured start is crucial for successful execution. Take time to set up properly.
