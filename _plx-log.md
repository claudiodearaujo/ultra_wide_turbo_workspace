# ⏱️ Log Work Hours

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to record your work activities and time spent in a structured format in our-hours.md.

## 1. Create Work Entry
[ ] Create a new timestamped entry in [our-hours.md](our-hours.md).

Add an entry using the format [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] with duration, completed tasks, modified files, and current milestone progress. This establishes a clear record of work completed.

## 2. Document Details
[ ] Record all work details including time, tasks, and files.

Document the session duration, list all completed tasks, note modified files with their changes, and update the milestone progress percentage. This ensures comprehensive activity tracking.

## 3. Verify Entry
[ ] Review the entry for completeness and accuracy.

Check that the timestamp, duration, tasks, files, and progress are all properly documented and formatted. This final verification ensures the work log remains consistent and reliable.

Remember:
- Be specific about tasks completed
- Include all modified files
- Keep entries consistent
