# ⚙️ Configure Framework

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to gather and apply system-wide configuration changes that will affect the entire framework's behavior.

## 1. Gather Requirements
[ ] Ask user what configuration changes they want to make.

Discuss with user their desired changes to framework behavior, such as test running, communication style, documentation patterns, development workflow, file organization, or version control practices. Get specific details about their motivation and expectations.

## 2. Analyze Impact
[ ] Review all framework files to map required changes.

Scan through all plx-*.md protocols, your-*.md personal files, our-*.md shared files, the-*.md processes, and system-prompt.md to identify affected sections, dependencies, and relationships. Create a clear plan for implementing changes consistently.

## 3. Present Plan
[ ] Share detailed analysis and get approval before making changes.

Show the user exactly what files and behaviors will be affected, what specific modifications are needed, and what implications the changes will have. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding with any updates.

## 4. Apply Changes
[ ] Update all affected files consistently.

Modify the system prompt, protocols, processes and documentation while maintaining cross-file alignment. Document all changes and rationale in [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) to maintain a clear record of the framework's configuration state.

Remember:
- Get clear understanding before changes
- Ensure system-wide consistency 
- Document in your-memory
- Verify cross-file alignment
- Keep framework coherent
