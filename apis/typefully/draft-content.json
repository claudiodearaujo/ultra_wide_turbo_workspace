Always test your agent's:\n- Basic comprehension\n- Context retention\n- Task execution ability\n\nWork WITH the model's strengths 💪\n\n2️⃣ Clear Direction (Structure)\nStructure is everything! Set up your workspace right:\n\n📝 Requirements doc\n🎯 Detailed tickets\n🚀 Clear milestones\n✅ Todo tracking\n\nClear documentation = Better results\n\n3️⃣ Maintained Focus (Execution)\nThe secret sauce? State management!\n\n🔄 Track progress consistently\n📝 Document everything\n💾 Persist context between sessions\n🤝 Enable seamless handovers\n\nNever lose your agent's train of thought!\n\n🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n\n❌ Relying on single-session memory\n❌ Using vague instructions\n❌ Ignoring context management\n❌ Skipping documentation\n\nRemember: Great GPT agents aren't born, they're built through careful implementation! 🛠️\n\n#AI #Development #GPT",
