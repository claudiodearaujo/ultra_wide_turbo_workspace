# ðŸ”„ Sync Check

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to perform a comprehensive check to ensure all workspace files are properly synchronized and aligned with current requirements.

## 1. Check Memory and Requirements
[ ] Review memory and requirements files for completeness and accuracy.

Review [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) and [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) to verify proper documentation of decisions, context, and requirements. Ensure all entries are properly timestamped and requirements match current implementation.

## 2. Verify Resources and Progress
[ ] Validate resource documentation and todo list status.

Review [your-resources.md](your-resources.md) to confirm all references are current and categorized correctly. Check [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) to verify milestone progress, completed tasks, and test status.

## 3. Document Findings
[ ] Create a sync report documenting issues and needed updates.

Create a detailed report listing any inconsistencies, missing components, or areas needing optimization across all workspace files. Include specific recommendations for realignment and request guidance if needed.

## 4. Present Sync Status
[ ] Summarize findings and propose next steps.

Present a clear summary of the sync status, highlighting critical issues and proposing specific solutions. Include a prioritized list of updates needed to maintain proper synchronization across all components.

Remember: Focus on maintaining optimal file organization while preserving all necessary context and relationships.
