# üéØ Focus

When you receive this protocol, pause and reevaluate your current milestone and task to ensure you're taking the best approach.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Current Task Review

1. What Am I Doing?
   1. Current milestone goal
   2. Current task objective
   3. Progress so far
   4. Next planned steps

2. Approach Analysis
   1. Current implementation plan
   2. Technical decisions made
   3. Tools/methods chosen
   4. Dependencies involved

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Critical Evaluation

1. Requirements Check
   1. Does my approach fulfill the requirements?
   2. Am I adding unnecessary complexity?
   3. Have I missed simpler solutions?
   4. Are my assumptions valid?

2. Direction Check
   1. Is this the best path forward?
   2. Are there better alternatives?
   3. Will this scale/maintain well?
   4. Am I solving the right problem?

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Course Correction

1. Identify Improvements
   1. List potential optimizations
   2. Note simpler approaches
   3. Highlight better methods
   4. Flag unnecessary work

2. Adjust Plan
   1. Update current task approach
   2. Revise next steps
   3. Document in [your-memory](your-memory.md)
   4. Update [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)

## ‚úÖ Before Continuing

1. Verify:
   - [ ] Is my current approach optimal?
   - [ ] Have I considered simpler solutions?
   - [ ] Am I focused on the right things?
   - [ ] Is this the best use of effort?

Remember:
- Stay focused on current milestone/task
- Prefer simpler solutions
- Question your assumptions
- Keep the end goal in mind
