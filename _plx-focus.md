# ðŸŽ¯ Focus

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to pause and critically evaluate your current approach to ensure you're solving the right problem in the most effective way.

## 1. Review Current Task
[ ] Document your current milestone, task, and progress.

Review and document your current milestone goal, specific task objective, progress made so far, and planned next steps. This establishes a clear picture of where you are in the development process.

## 2. Analyze Approach
[ ] Evaluate your technical decisions and implementation plan.

Examine your current implementation approach, including technical decisions made, tools and methods chosen, and any dependencies involved. This validates your technical direction.

## 3. Check Requirements
[ ] Verify your approach meets requirements without unnecessary complexity.

Review requirements fulfillment, checking for unnecessary complexity, simpler alternative solutions, and validity of core assumptions. This ensures you're taking the optimal path forward.

## 4. Adjust Course
[ ] Update your plan based on evaluation findings.

Document improvements and revise your approach in [your-memory.md](your-memory.md), then update [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) with any changes to next steps. This sets you up for successful continuation.

Remember:
- Stay focused on current milestone/task
- Prefer simpler solutions
- Question your assumptions
- Keep the end goal in mind
