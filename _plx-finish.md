# üèÅ Project Finalization

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to perform final quality checks and documentation updates to prepare the project for completion or release.

## 1. Review Documentation
[ ] Verify all documentation is complete and accurate.

Check that README.md contains current features and setup steps, CHANGELOG.md follows semantic versioning, and all code has proper documentation according to project standards. Update any outdated or missing documentation.

## 2. Run Quality Checks
[ ] Execute all tests and quality verification tools.

Run the full test suite, check code coverage meets requirements, run linters, and verify all best practices are followed. Document any exceptions and fix critical issues.

## 3. Validate Dependencies
[ ] Check all project dependencies and configurations.

Review dependencies for updates and compatibility issues, verify configuration files are correct, and ensure build scripts work properly. Test the full deployment process if applicable.

## 4. Complete Final Checklist
[ ] Verify all completion requirements are met.

Go through the final checklist including documentation completeness, test status, code quality standards, and project state requirements. Get explicit user approval on any remaining items needing attention.

Remember: Always check with the user about specific requirements or preferences before making significant changes. Different projects may have different standards and needs.
