# ü§ù Ask Smarter Agent

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to create a detailed request for a more capable agent to help solve a complex problem.

## 1. Document Current Issue
[ ] Write a clear problem statement with all relevant details.

Explain the exact issue you're facing, including what you're trying to achieve, where you're stuck, your current state, and the desired outcome. This gives the agent the full picture of what needs to be solved.

## 2. Provide Complete Context
[ ] Gather and share all context that could help solve the problem.

Include all relevant files, code snippets, environment details, and related information that might impact the solution. The more context you provide, the better equipped the agent will be to help.

## 3. Share Previous Work
[ ] Document all previous attempts and research.

Detail everything you've already tried, including approaches taken, results received, and your understanding of why they didn't work. Also include any research done, resources checked, and areas where you're unclear.

## 4. Specify Your Request
[ ] Clearly state exactly what help you need from the agent.

Outline the specific areas where you need help, any critical requirements or constraints, points of confusion, and your own thoughts or ideas about potential solutions. Be explicit about what kind of assistance would be most valuable.
