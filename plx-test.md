# üß™ Test Verification

When you receive this protocol, verify test coverage and ensure all tests have proper implementations.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test Analysis

1. Scan Test Files
   1. Find all test files
   2. Identify pending tests
   3. Note placeholder implementations
   4. List skipped tests

2. Implementation Status
   1. Check test descriptions vs code
   2. Find missing implementations
   3. Note incomplete features
   4. List test dependencies

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test Validation

1. Check Test Quality
   1. Review test structure
   2. Verify assertions
   3. Check edge cases
   4. Note test gaps

2. Implementation Review
   1. Compare against requirements
   2. Check test-code alignment
   3. Verify behavior coverage
   4. Note missing scenarios

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation

1. Prioritize Tests
   1. List pending implementations
   2. Order by dependencies
   3. Note blocking issues
   4. Plan test sequence

2. Complete Tests
   1. Implement pending tests
   2. Add missing assertions
   3. Fill placeholder code
   4. Run test suite

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verification

1. Run Tests
   1. Execute full suite
   2. Check coverage metrics
   3. Verify all passing
   4. Document results

2. Update Documentation
   1. Record test status
   2. Update coverage info
   3. Note improvements
   4. Link to requirements

## ‚úÖ Completion Check

1. Test Status
   - [ ] All tests implemented
   - [ ] No pending tests
   - [ ] No placeholders
   - [ ] Suite passing

2. Coverage
   - [ ] Requirements met
   - [ ] Edge cases covered
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Results recorded

Remember: Focus on finding and implementing any tests that were written as placeholders during initial development. Ensure all tests have proper implementations before proceeding.
