# ðŸ”„ Refine Requirements

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to analyze user input and refine requirements by mapping relationships, defining properties, and planning implementation.

## 1. Analyze Input
[ ] Extract key concepts and identify the primary focus area.

Review user input to determine if it's user-focused (Actors), feature-focused (Activities), data-focused (Properties), or rules-focused (Behaviors). Map initial relationships and constraints while checking [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) for affected items.

## 2. Map Relationships
[ ] Document all relationships using the relationship framework.

Follow the relationship guide (Actor â†’ performs â†’ Activity, Component â†’ supports â†’ Activity, etc.) using [[square brackets]] for links. Define properties, constraints, validations and behaviors for each component.

## 3. Plan Implementation
[ ] Create linked todo items and document context.

Add tasks to [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) with requirement links and dependencies. Update [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) with key decisions, assumptions and open questions.

## 4. Validate Changes
[ ] Verify all requirements are properly defined and linked.

Check that all items are linked, properties are defined, behaviors are documented, relationships are mapped, and implementation todos are created. Ensure there are no orphaned items and all documentation is current.

Remember:
- Only check off parent items when ALL children are complete
- Always use [[square brackets]] for relationships
- Create implementation todos for each item
- Document all decisions and assumptions
