CONTEXT: The [[User]] wants to create a new feature breakdown and needs you to handle the creation process following our standard format and structure.

1. GIVEN [[User]] RUNS plx-create-feature-breakdown command
   1. THEN [[You]] READ [[input]]
      1. AND [[You]] CHECK feature type
         ```markdown
         # Feature Types
         - ui          : User interface components
         - api         : API implementations
         - integration : Third-party integrations
         - core        : Core functionality
         ```
      2. AND [[You]] CHECK required parameters
         ```markdown
         # Required Parameters
         - title        : Name in Pascal Case With Spaces
         - type         : One of the feature types above
         - difficulty   : 游릭 Easy | 游리 Medium | 游댮 Hard
         - readingTime  : Duration (e.g., "15 minutes")
         ```
   2. IF [[input]] IS empty
      1. THEN [[You]] ASK [[User]] for feature type
      2. AND [[You]] ASK for required parameters

2. WHEN [[You]] CREATES breakdown
   1. THEN [[You]] CREATE file in features directory
      ```markdown
      # File Location
      feature-breakdowns/title-in-lowercase-with-dashes.md
      ```
   2. THEN [[You]] ADD frontmatter
      ```markdown
      # Frontmatter Format

      document_type: feature-breakdown
      title: Title In Pascal Case
      difficulty: 游릭 | 游리 | 游댮
      reading_time: "15 minutes"
      feature_type: ui | api | integration | core
      gpt_action: follow these steps to understand [title]

      1. AND [[You]] LIST all sections
      2. AND [[You]] ADD reading time estimates
      3. AND [[You]] ADD difficulty indicators

      2. AND [[You]] ADD feature overview screenshot
      3. AND [[You]] ADD "Prerequisites"
      4. AND [[You]] ADD "What You'll Learn"
      5. AND [[You]] ADD real-world use cases
   3. THEN [[You]] WRITE The Plan
      1. AND [[You]] CREATE numbered steps
      2. AND [[You]] ADD concept visualizations
      3. AND [[You]] ADD "Think About It" questions
      4. AND [[You]] ADD alternative approaches
   4. THEN [[You]] WRITE Implementation
      1. AND [[You]] ADD code snippets with comments
      2. AND [[You]] ADD implementation screenshots

   6. THEN [[You]] WRITE Reflection
      1. AND [[You]] DISCUSS pros and cons
      2. AND [[You]] ADD performance notes
      3. AND [[You]] ADD security considerations
      4. AND [[You]] ADD future improvements

4. GIVEN [[breakdown]] IS ready
   1. THEN [[You]] ADD image placeholders
      1. AND [[You]] USE format
         ```markdown
         [SCREENSHOT: Feature overview showing final result]
         [GIF: Key user interactions with the feature]
         [STOCK: Concept visualization for complex parts]
         ```
   2. THEN [[You]] VERIFY style guidelines
      1. AND [[You]] CHECK emoticons
      2. AND [[You]] CHECK formatting
