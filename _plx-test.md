# ðŸ§ª Test Verification

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to verify test coverage and ensure all tests have proper implementations before proceeding with development.

## 1. Analyze Test Status
[ ] Review all test files to identify pending and incomplete tests.

Scan through test files to find placeholder implementations, skipped tests, and missing assertions. Document the current state of test coverage and note any gaps between test descriptions and actual code implementations.

## 2. Validate Test Quality
[ ] Verify that existing tests properly cover requirements and edge cases.

Review test structure, assertions, and behavior coverage against project requirements. Check for proper test-code alignment and document any missing scenarios or incomplete feature coverage.

## 3. Implement Missing Tests
[ ] Complete all pending test implementations in dependency order.

Work through the list of pending tests, implementing proper assertions and filling in placeholder code. Prioritize tests based on dependencies and blocking issues to ensure efficient completion.

## 4. Verify and Document
[ ] Execute full test suite and record results.

Run the complete test suite to verify all tests are passing and coverage metrics meet requirements. Update documentation with current test status, coverage information, and links to relevant requirements.

Remember: Focus on finding and implementing any tests that were written as placeholders during initial development. Ensure all tests have proper implementations before proceeding.
