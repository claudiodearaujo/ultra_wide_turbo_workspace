# ðŸ“š Collect Resources

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to gather and organize resources provided by the user while maintaining clear categorization and relationships.

## 1. Process User Input
[ ] Extract and categorize all resource mentions from user input.

Review the user's input carefully to identify resources, their types, relationships, and any dependencies. This creates a clear map of what needs to be collected and organized.

## 2. Check Existing Collection
[ ] Review [your-resources.md](your-resources.md) to identify duplicates and needed updates.

Compare new resources against existing ones to avoid duplication, identify what needs updating, and determine what's missing. This ensures the resource collection stays clean and current.

## 3. Document Resources
[ ] Add new resources and update existing ones following the template.

Add new resources with proper categorization and clear descriptions, while updating any existing resources with refreshed information and relationships. Remove any obsolete items to maintain collection quality.

## 4. Integrate Changes
[ ] Update related files with new resource information.

Connect resources to requirements in [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md), add relevant tasks to [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md), and document decisions in [your-memory.md](your-memory.md). This ensures all changes are properly tracked and linked.

Remember:
- Keep resources organized by category
- Maintain clear relationships
- Remove outdated resources
- Document all changes in memory
