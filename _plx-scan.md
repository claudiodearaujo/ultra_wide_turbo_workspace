# üîç Scan Repository

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to perform a comprehensive scan of the repository to build or refresh your understanding of the codebase and update your context files accordingly.

## 1. Scan Repository Structure
[ ] Review all directories and files to understand project organization.

Use git ls-files or directory listing to get a complete view of the repository structure, noting key directories, file patterns, and organizational principles.

## 2. Analyze Core Files
[ ] Review and document key project files and their purposes.

Examine README.md, configuration files, dependency files, and core documentation to understand project setup, dependencies, and architecture.

## 3. Update Memory
[ ] Document findings in your memory file.

Add a detailed scan entry to [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) including project structure, key components, relationships, and important patterns discovered.

## 4. Update Requirements
[ ] Sync requirements with discovered implementation.

Review and update [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of implementation and any newly discovered requirements.

## 5. Update Resources
[ ] Document discovered tools and references.

Add newly found resources, tools, libraries, and references to [your-resources.md](your-resources.md), organizing them by category and relevance.

## 6. Update Todo List
[ ] Sync todo list with current project state.

Review and update [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) to reflect the current state of implementation, adding any discovered pending tasks or technical debt.

Remember:
- Focus on building a comprehensive understanding
- Document all significant findings
- Update all your files to reflect current state
- Note any inconsistencies or concerns
