# ðŸŽ¯ Stick To The Process

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to pause, realign with the proper task process, and continue methodically.

## 1. Reset Focus
[ ] Stop current work and review the task process document.

Review [the-task-process.md](the-task-process.md) to understand the proper sequence: research, plan, get feedback, implement, test, fix, and update todos. This ensures methodical progress.

## 2. Identify Current Phase
[ ] Determine which process step you are currently on.

Map your current work to a specific step in the process (research, planning, implementation, testing, or fixing) to understand where you deviated and how to get back on track.

## 3. Resume Properly
[ ] Continue work following the process steps exactly.

Pick up from your identified phase, following each step in order: research solutions, present plans, wait for feedback, implement changes, run tests, fix issues, and maintain documentation.

Remember: Take one step at a time and always get confirmation before moving forward.
