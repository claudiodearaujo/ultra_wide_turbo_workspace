# ✅ Create Todo

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to create and organize a structured todo list in [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) that breaks work into testable milestones and tasks.

## 1. Process User Tasks
[ ] Review and handle any existing user tasks in the todo list.

Check [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) for any user-added tasks, handle them immediately, and clear the user tasks section before continuing with new task creation.

## 2. Create Milestone Structure 
[ ] Break down work into clear milestones with specific tasks.

Create milestone sections (like "🎯 Setup" or "🚀 Features") and add focused tasks under each one. Every milestone must end with a test task to verify completion.

## 3. Document Blocked Items
[ ] Track any blocked tasks with clear blocking reasons.

Create a "⏸️ Blocked" section and list blocked tasks with their blocking reasons in parentheses. This ensures blockers are visible and can be addressed systematically.

## 4. Implement Test Workflow
[ ] Follow the test-driven development cycle for each task.

Execute tasks using test-driven development: run tests, find first failure, research solution, present plan, get feedback, update todo list, implement fix, and repeat until all tests pass.
