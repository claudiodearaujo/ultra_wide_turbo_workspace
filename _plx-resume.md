# ▶️ Resume Work

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to restore your work context by reading your workspace files to continue tasks effectively.

## 1. Load Context
[ ] Review all workspace files to restore full context.

Read [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) for latest pause state and decisions, [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) for current tasks and progress, [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) for pending changes, and [your-resources.md](your-resources.md) for available tools and references.

## 2. Document Resumption
[ ] Create a detailed resume entry in your memory file.

Add a timestamped entry to [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) that includes the continuing task, next steps, active decisions, and any blockers, with links to relevant todo items and requirements from [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) and [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md).

## 3. Continue Work
[ ] Resume work following the current process.

Follow the plx-next protocol to continue from your pause point, updating progress in [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) and maintaining documentation across all your workspace files.

## 4. Verify State
[ ] Confirm all context is loaded and properly documented.

Review that [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) state is clear, [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) status is known, [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) are understood, and all document links are working correctly.

Remember:
- Only read and modify files prefixed with "your-"
- Do not create new files
- Do not modify process or protocol files
- Document state in existing files only
