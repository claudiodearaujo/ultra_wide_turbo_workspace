# âž• Add to System

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to add new content and ensure it is properly integrated across all framework documents.

## 1. Identify Content Type
[ ] Determine what type of content is being added and where it belongs.

Review the content to classify it as a task, requirement, test case, documentation, or decision. This determines which framework document will serve as its primary location:

- Tasks -> [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md)
- Requirements -> [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) 
- Decisions -> [your-memory.md](your-memory.md)
- Resources -> [your-resources.md](your-resources.md)

## 2. Add Primary Content
[ ] Add the content to its primary framework document with proper formatting.

Place the content in the correct document following that document's structure and formatting rules. See [the-development-process.md](the-development-process.md) for guidance.

## 3. Create Memory Entry
[ ] Document this addition in [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) with full context.

Add a timestamped entry that explains what was added, why it was added, and how it relates to other framework elements.

## 4. Update Related Documents
[ ] Update all related documents to maintain system consistency.

Review and update any documents affected by this addition, ensuring all cross-references are correct and statuses are consistent across the framework. Key documents to check:

- [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md)
- [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md)
- [your-memory.md](your-memory.md)
- [your-resources.md](your-resources.md)
