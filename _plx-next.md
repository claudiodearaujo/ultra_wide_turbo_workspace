# ⏭️ Next Task

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to find and complete the next highest priority task in your todo list.

## 1. Find Priority Task
[ ] Check todo list for the next highest priority task.

Review [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) for any user-added tasks as these take priority. If none exist, take the first unchecked task from your current milestone to ensure you're working on the most important item.

## 2. Execute Task Process
[ ] Complete the task following the standard process.

Follow the steps in [the-task-process.md](the-task-process.md) exactly - research thoroughly, present your plan, wait for approval, implement with tests, and verify everything works as expected.

## 3. Record Progress
[ ] Update the todo list with completed task.

Mark the task as complete in [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) to maintain an accurate record of progress. This keeps everyone informed of the current project state.
