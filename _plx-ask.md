## 2. Identify Information Gaps
[ ] List specific questions that would improve task clarity.

Create focused questions about requirements ("Could X be more specific?"), approach ("Is method A optimal?"), and direction ("Are there missing dependencies?"). Ensure each question would meaningfully improve the current task.

## 3. Present Questions
