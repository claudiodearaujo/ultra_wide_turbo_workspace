# üîÑ Refine Requirements

When you receive this protocol, analyze user input and refine requirements following [the-refinement-process](the-refinement-process.md).

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Analysis

1. Process User Input
   1. Extract key concepts
   2. Identify starting point:
      - User-focused (Actors)
      - Feature-focused (Activities)
      - Data-focused (Properties)
      - Rules-focused (Behaviors)
   3. List initial relationships
   4. Note constraints

2. Review Current State
   1. Check [your-requirements](your-requirements.md)
   2. Identify affected items
   3. Note existing relationships
   4. List impacted areas

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Refinement Process

1. Map Relationships
   1. Follow relationship guide:
      - Actor ‚Üí performs ‚Üí Activity
      - Component ‚Üí supports ‚Üí Activity
      - Activity ‚Üí uses ‚Üí Component
      - Activity ‚Üí has ‚Üí Properties
      - Activity ‚Üí follows ‚Üí Behaviour
   2. Use [[square brackets]] for links
   3. Document connections
   4. Verify completeness

2. Define Properties
   1. List characteristics
   2. Set constraints
   3. Define validations
   4. Document behaviors

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Planning

1. Create Todo Items
   1. Add to [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   2. Link to requirements
   3. Set dependencies
   4. Define milestones

2. Document Context
   1. Update [your-memory](your-memory.md)
   2. Note key decisions
   3. Record assumptions
   4. List open questions

## ‚úÖ Validation

1. Check Requirements
   - [ ] All items properly linked
   - [ ] Properties defined
   - [ ] Behaviors documented
   - [ ] Relationships mapped

2. Verify Process
   - [ ] Starting point clear
   - [ ] Sub-items complete
   - [ ] Todos created
   - [ ] Tests identified

3. Review Completeness
   - [ ] No orphaned items
   - [ ] All relationships defined
   - [ ] Implementation path clear
   - [ ] Documentation updated

Remember:
- Only check off parent items when ALL children are complete
- Always use [[square brackets]] for relationships
- Create implementation todos for each item
- Document all decisions and assumptions
