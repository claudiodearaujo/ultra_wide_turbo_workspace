# ðŸš€ The Development Process

After completing [the-refinement-process](the-refinement-process.md) and having well-defined requirements, use this document to guide you through the implementation process.

## ðŸ“š Rules

1. Always start with requirements review
2. Follow test-driven development
3. Document all decisions
4. Keep status updated
5. Link everything

## ðŸ‘£ Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   1. Review refined requirements from [your-requirements](your-requirements.md)
   2. Research implementation approach
   3. Ensure testable milestones are present in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   4. Break down first milestone into todos in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   5. Document research findings in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   1. Create test file for implementation
   2. Write failing tests first
   3. Research and prepare solution thoroughly
   4. Implement solution
   5. Run tests
   6. After three consecutive fails:
      1. Take a step back
      2. Research new solution
      3. Get approval
      4. Document learnings in [your-memory](your-memory.md)
      5. Update approach in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)

3. **Feedback Loop**
   1. Request feedback
   2. Process feedback
   3. Update [your-requirements](your-requirements.md)
   4. Document feedback in [your-memory](your-memory.md)
   5. Update milestones/todos in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)

4. **Documentation**
   1. Update documentation
   2. Update status in [your-requirements](your-requirements.md)
   3. Log work done in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

## ðŸ”„ Development Cycle

1. **Take A Step Back**
   1. Review current implementation state
   2. Understand technical challenges
   3. Document insights in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

2. **Get Overview**
   1. Review current milestone in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   2. Map out code changes needed
   3. Identify technical dependencies

3. **Research Solution**
   1. Explore possible approaches
   2. Consider best practices
   3. Review similar implementations
   4. Document findings in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

4. **Make Plan**
   1. Break down into clear todos in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   2. Create test strategy
   3. Document technical decisions in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

5. **Execute**
   1. Follow todos in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   2. Write clean, maintainable code
   3. Document blockers/solutions in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

6. **Test**
   1. Write unit tests
   2. Verify functionality
   3. Check edge cases
   4. Document test insights in [your-memory](your-memory.md)

7. **Repeat**
   1. Mark completed todos in [your-todo-list](your-todo-list.md)
   2. Move to next milestone
   3. Document progress in [your-memory](your-memory.md)
