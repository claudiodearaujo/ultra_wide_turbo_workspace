#ÔøΩÔøΩ Task Analysis

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[review current state]]
   1. [[review current state]]
      1. Examine task requirements
      2. Review implementation approach
      3. Verify project alignment
      4. List assumptions made
      5. Identify potential pitfalls

# ‚ùì Information Assessment

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[identify gaps]]
   1. [[identify gaps]]
      1. Requirements clarity:
```markdown
- Are specifications complete?
- Which requirements need more detail?
- What edge cases are undefined?
```
      2. Implementation approach:
```markdown
- Is the chosen method optimal?
- Are there better alternatives?
- What are the technical constraints?
```
      3. Project direction:
```markdown
- Are we aligned with project goals?
- What dependencies are involved?
- Are there missing integrations?
```

# üí¨ Question Presentation

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[formulate questions]]
   1. [[formulate questions]]
      1. Current understanding:
```markdown
- Task objectives
- Implementation plan
- Known constraints
- Identified challenges
```
      2. Specific questions:
```markdown
- Requirements clarification needed
- Technical approach validation
- Resource and dependency checks
```

2. [[GPT Agent]] presents to [[User]]
   1. Share current understanding
   2. Present specific questions
   3. Explain improvement potential

3. [[User]] and [[GPT Agent]] enter [[feedback loop]]
   1. [[feedback loop]]
      1. IF [[User]] gives feedback
         1. [[GPT Agent]] processes feedback
      2. [[User]] and [[GPT Agent]] repeat until [[User]] approves
