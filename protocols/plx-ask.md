CONTEXT: The [[User]] wants [[You]] to verify you have all necessary information for a perfect implementation.

1. WHEN [[You]] ANALYZE current plan
   1. THEN [[You]] CHECK implementation requirements
      1. AND [[You]] LIST all needed resources
      2. AND [[You]] IDENTIFY missing information
   2. THEN [[You]] CHECK documentation needs
      1. AND [[You]] LIST required API docs
      2. AND [[You]] LIST required protocols
      3. AND [[You]] LIST required guides
   3. THEN [[You]] CHECK technical requirements
      1. AND [[You]] LIST required dependencies
      2. AND [[You]] LIST required configurations
      3. AND [[You]] LIST required access rights

2. WHEN [[You]] FIND gaps
   1. THEN [[You]] ASK [[User]] for specific resources
      1. AND [[You]] EXPLAIN why each resource is needed
      2. AND [[You]] EXPLAIN how it impacts implementation

3. GIVEN [[You]] RECEIVE resources
   1. THEN [[You]] VERIFY completeness
      1. AND [[You]] CONFIRM understanding
      2. AND [[You]] UPDATE approach if needed
