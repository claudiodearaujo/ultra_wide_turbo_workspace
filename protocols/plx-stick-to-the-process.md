# 🛑 Process Check

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[pause work]]
   1. [[pause work]]
      1. Stop current activity
      2. Save current state
      3. Clear current approach
      4. IF [[work unsaved]]
         1. [[GPT Agent]] preserves progress

2. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[review workflow]]
   1. [[review workflow]]
      1. Check phases:
```markdown
# Development Phases
- 🧱 Planning
  - Research solution
  - Create plan
  - Get feedback
- 🛠️ Development
  - Start new task
  - Complete task
  - Run tests
  - Fix issues
- 🚀 Release
  - Final testing
  - Present work
  - Release process
```

# 🎯 Process Realignment

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[locate position]]
   1. [[locate position]]
      1. Current state:
```markdown
# Position Check
- Current phase
- Last completed step
- Next required step
- Missing steps
```
      2. Process gaps:
```markdown
# Gap Analysis
- Skipped steps
- Missing feedback
- Incomplete tests
- Required fixes
```

2. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[verify alignment]]
   1. [[verify alignment]]
      1. Check completion
      2. Validate steps
      3. Confirm order
      4. IF [[steps missing]]
         1. [[GPT Agent]] returns to last good state

# 🔄 Process Resumption

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[resume process]]
   1. [[resume process]]
      1. From correct step:
```markdown
# Resumption Point
- Start from last good state
- Follow steps in order
- No step skipping
- Get required feedback
```

2. [[GPT Agent]] presents plan to [[User]]

3. [[User]] and [[GPT Agent]] enter [[feedback loop]]
   1. [[feedback loop]]
      1. IF [[User]] gives feedback
         1. [[GPT Agent]] processes feedback
      2. [[User]] and [[GPT Agent]] repeat until [[User]] approves
