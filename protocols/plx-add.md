# 🔍 Initial Research

1. [[GPT Agent]] [[analyze content type]]
   1. [[analyze content type]]
      1. Review content purpose and scope
      2. Identify primary framework document:
         - Requirements → `your-requirements.md`
         - Ticket → `your-ticket.md`
         - Todo List → `your-todo-list.md`
      3. Map relationships to core pillars
      4. Check impact on development workflow

2. [[GPT Agent]] [[verify framework alignment]]
   1. [[verify framework alignment]]
      1. Check alignment with core pillars:
         - Requirements completeness
         - Ticket specifications
         - Todo list organization
      2. Review development workflow impact:
         - Planning phase needs
         - Development phase changes
         - Release phase considerations

# 🛠️ Implementation

1. [[GPT Agent]] [[update requirements]]
   1. [[update requirements]]
      1. Add to `your-requirements.md`:
```markdown
# 👤 Actors & 🧩 Components
- [[New Actor]]
  - [[Activity]]
  - [[Property]]

# 🎬 Activities
- [[New Activity]]
  - [[Flow]]
  - [[Test]]

# 🛠️ Behaviours
- [[New Behaviour]]
  - [[Rule]]
  - [[Test]]
```

2. [[GPT Agent]] [[update ticket]]
   1. [[update ticket]]
      1. Update `your-ticket.md`:
```markdown
# 🔖 Description
[Clear description of changes]

# 🗣 User Story
As a [role] I want [feature] so that [benefit]

# ⚙️ Requirements
[Link to requirements section]

# 💾 Data Model
[Data model changes]

# 🔒 Security Rules
[Security considerations]

# 🧪 Tests
[Test scenarios]
```

3. [[GPT Agent]] [[update todo list]]
   1. [[update todo list]]
      1. Add to `your-todo-list.md`:
```markdown
# 🎯 Current Milestone
- [ ] Planning Phase
  - [ ] Research requirements
  - [ ] Create implementation plan
  - [ ] Define test scenarios

- [ ] Development Phase
  - [ ] Implement feature
  - [ ] Add tests
  - [ ] Update documentation

- [ ] Release Phase
  - [ ] Run final tests
  - [ ] Present work summary
  - [ ] Get user feedback
```

# ✅ Verification

         - Test scenarios documented
      3. Todo list organized:
         - Tasks follow workflow phases
         - Clear milestones defined
         - Test tasks included

2. [[GPT Agent]] [[verify workflow alignment]]
   1. [[verify workflow alignment]]
      1. Planning phase properly documented
      2. Development steps clearly defined
      3. Release criteria established
      4. Process adherence confirmed

3. [[GPT Agent]] [[verify system integrity]]
   1. [[verify system integrity]]
      1. All cross-references valid
      2. Documentation consistent
      3. Framework integrity maintained
      4. Process patterns followed
