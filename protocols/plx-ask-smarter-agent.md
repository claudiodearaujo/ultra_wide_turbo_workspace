# üß±ÔøΩ Problem Analysis

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[analyze problem]]
   1. [[analyze problem]]
      1. Write clear problem statement
      2. Define current state
      3. Define desired outcome
      4. List specific challenges
      5. IF [[problem unclear]]
         1. [[GPT Agent]] asks [[User]] for clarification

2. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[gather context]]
   1. [[gather context]]
      1. Collect relevant files:
```markdown
- Source code files
- Configuration files
- Documentation files
- Test files
```
      2. Collect environment details:
```markdown
- Development environment
- Runtime environment
- Dependencies
- Version information
```

# üìù Request Preparation

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[document attempts]]
   1. [[document attempts]]
      1. List previous approaches:
```markdown
# Previous Attempts
1. Approach: [description]
   - Result: [what happened]
   - Issue: [why it failed]

2. Approach: [description]
   - Result: [what happened]
   - Issue: [why it failed]
```
      2. Document research findings:
```markdown
# Research Done
- Resources checked
- Documentation reviewed
- Similar issues found
- Current understanding
```

2. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[formulate request]]
   1. [[formulate request]]
      1. Specify help needed:
```markdown
# Help Needed
1. Specific areas requiring assistance
2. Critical requirements or constraints
3. Points of confusion
4. Current theories or ideas
```
      2. IF [[request unclear]]
         1. [[GPT Agent]] refines request details
         2. [[GPT Agent]] adds more context

# üì§ Request Submission

1. [[GPT Agent]] starts [[verify request quality]]
   1. [[verify request quality]]
      1. Check problem statement:
         - Clear and specific
         - Includes current state
         - Defines desired outcome
      2. Check context completeness:
         - All relevant files included
         - Environment details provided
         - Previous attempts documented
      3. Check request clarity:
         - Specific help areas defined
         - Requirements clear
         - Constraints listed

2. [[GPT Agent]] presents request to [[User]]

3. [[User]] and [[GPT Agent]] enter [[feedback loop]]
   1. [[feedback loop]]
      1. IF [[User]] gives feedback
         1. [[GPT Agent]] processes feedback
      2. [[User]] and [[GPT Agent]] repeat until [[User]] approves

4. [[GPT Agent]] submits request to smarter agent
