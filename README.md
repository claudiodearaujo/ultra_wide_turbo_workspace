## üîç Quick Start

Create a new Ultra Wide Turbo Agent Workspace using the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/create_workspace.sh
```

The script will:
1. Generate a default workspace name (e.g. `turbo-workspace-0801-wed-01`)
   - Format: `turbo-workspace-MMDD-ddd-NN`
   - `MM`: Month (08)
   - `DD`: Day (01)
   - `ddd`: Day of week (wed)
   - `NN`: Sequential number (01)

2. Let you select which components to include:
   - Agent Work Documents (your-*.md files)
   - Protocols
   - Workflows
   - Templates
   - Code of Conduct
   - Prompts
   - Scripts
   - Concepts

3. Create the workspace with selected components. You can also provide a custom name when prompted. You can find your workspaces in the `workspaces` folder.

## üîç Framework Overview

This framework enhances your AI agent's capabilities through three core pillars and a clear development workflow. It ensures high-quality, tested implementations by maintaining clear requirements, detailed tickets, and organized task lists.

We believe AI agents perform at their best when three key elements align:

1. **Quality Training** (out of our hands)
   - Trained on relevant data
   - Proper model capabilities
   - Good base understanding

2. **Clear Direction**
   - Well-defined requirements
   - Structured processes
   - Clear documentation
   - Proper templates
   - Small, clear task scope

3. **Maintained Focus**
   - Regular progress tracking
   - Consistent documentation
   - Clear communication
   - Process adherence
   - Preserved context across sessions
   - Active context awareness
   - Proper state management
   - Seamless agent handover

## üìö Core Pillars

1. **[Requirements](#your-requirementsmd)** (`your-requirements.md`)
   - Comprehensive breakdown of what needs to be built
   - Actors, components, activities, properties, behaviors
   - Clear acceptance criteria and test scenarios

2. **[Ticket](#your-ticketmd)** (`your-ticket.md`)
   - Detailed task description and user story
   - Technical specifications and implementation details
   - Security, data models, and API requirements

3. **[Milestones](#your-milestonesmd)** (`your-milestones.md`)
   - Clear testable milestones with emoji sections
   - Dependencies and technical details per milestone
   - Progress tracking and completion criteria
   - Links to related tests and tasks

4. **[Todo List](#your-todo-listmd)** (`your-todo-list.md`)
   - Chronological atomic tasks under clear milestones
   - Progress tracking and task dependencies
   - Test tasks for each testable component

5. **[Tests](#your-testsmd)** (`your-tests.md`)
   - BDD Gherkin style test scenarios
   - Acceptance criteria validation
   - Integration and unit tests
   - Test coverage tracking

## üîÑ Development Workflow

The development workflow is split into two main files for better organization and clarity:

1. **Planning Workflow** (`the-planning-workflow.md`)
   ```markdown
---
document_type: workflow
goal: define core planning workflow
gpt_action: follow these steps for all planning work that you do
---

1. WHEN [[User]] GIVE [[input]].
	1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] RESEARCH solution based on [[input]].
		1. AND [[GPT Agent]] SCAN codebase.
		2. AND [[GPT Agent]] SEARCH documentation.
		3. AND [[GPT Agent]] ANALYSE [[your-requirements]]
		4. AND [[GPT Agent]] ANALYSE [[your-ticket]]
2. WHEN [[GPT Agent]] NEED more info
	1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ASK clarifying questions
3. GIVEN [[GPT Agent]] UNDERSTAND task perfectly
4. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ANALYSE [[the-work-documents]]
	1. IF [[your-requirements]] is empty
		1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ASK [[User]] whether [[GPT Agent]] should update [[your-requirements]]
			1. IF [[User]] CONFIRMS
				1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] UPDATE [[your-requirements]]
	2. IF [[your-ticket]] is empty
			1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ASK [[User]] whether [[GPT Agent]] should update ticket
				1. IF [[User]] CONFIRMS
					1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] UPDATE [[your-ticket]]
	1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] CREATE high level list of [[clear testable milestones]]
		1. AND [[GPT Agent]] UPDATE [[your-milestones]] with [[clear testable milestones]] as markdown sections with relevant emojis
		2. AND [[GPT Agent]] UPDATE [[your-milestones]] with [[BBD Gherkin style tests]] from [[your-requirements]] or [[your-ticket]] or [[GPT Agent]] own input
5. GIVEN [[GPT Agent]] DEFINED [[clear testable milestones]] in [[your-milestones]]
	1. AND [[GPT Agent]] DEFINED [[BBD Gherkin style tests]] in [[your-milestones]].
6. THEN [[GPT Agent]] UPDATE [[your-todo-list]] with [[step-by-step atomic development tasks]] for first completing first of [[clear testable milestones]].
7. GIVEN [[GPT Agent]] DEFINED [[clear testable milestones]] in [[your-milestones]]
	1. AND [[GPT Agent]] DEFINED [[BBD Gherkin style tests]] in [[your-milestones]]
	2. AND [[GPT Agent]] DEFINED [[step-by-step atomic development tasks]] in [[your-todo-list]]
8. THEN [[GPT Agent]] PRESENTS plan to [[User]]
	1. IF [[User]] GIVE feedback
		1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] PROCESS feedback
		2. AND [[GPT Agent]] REPEAT step 8
	2. ELSE IF [[User]] APPROVES
		1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] starts with first in [[your-todo-list]]
   ```

2. **Development Workflow** (`the-development-workflow.md`)
   ```markdown
document_type: workflow
goal: define core development workflow
gpt_action: follow these steps for all development work that you do
---

1. GIVEN [[GPT Agent]] HAS [[atomic development task]] in [[your-todo-list]]
	1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] RESEARCH approach for first [[atomic development task]]
2. THEN [[GPT Agent]] START [[atomic development task]]
3. WHEN [[GPT Agent]] FINISH [[atomic development task]]
	1. IF [[atomic development task]] IS last task
		1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] RUNS [[tests]] to confirm correct implementation of all [[atomic development task]]
			1. IF [[tests]] FAIL
				1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ANALYSE only first of failing [[tests]]
					1. AND [[GPT Agent]] FIX only first of failing [[tests]]
				2. WHEN [[GPT Agent]] FIX first of failing [[tests]]
				3. THEN [[GPT Agent]] RUNS [[tests]] again
					1. AND [[GPT Agent]] REPEATS process until all [[tests]] succeed
		2. GIVEN [[tests]] succeed
			1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] COMPLETE milestone in [[your-todo-list]]
				1. AND [[GPT Agent]] CREATE new list of [[atomic development task]] based on next milestone from [[your-milestones]]
				2. AND [[GPT Agent]] START this workflow from beginning
4. THEN [[GPT Agent]] START next [[atomic development task]]
	1. AND [[GPT Agent]] START this work from step 2
   ```

Each workflow follows a structured approach with clear steps and checkpoints to maintain consistency and quality throughout the development process. The planning phase ensures proper understanding and task breakdown, while the development phase focuses on systematic implementation and testing.

## üìö Code of Conduct

The code of conduct section contains documents that describe various concepts to the agent for reference. This includes:

- Development patterns and best practices
- Workflow guides and processes
- Implementation standards
- Documentation guidelines

The framework also provides directories for user-populated content:
- Case Studies
- Insights
- Tutorials
- Feature Breakdowns
- APIs

These sections can be customized and populated based on your project's needs.

## üíª API Integration

The framework uses a standardized approach for API integrations:

1. Each API has its own folder in `apis/` containing:
   - `docs.md`: API-specific documentation and request formats
   - `.env`: API keys and configuration
   - `request.json`: Current request data
   - `.gitignore`: Excludes sensitive files

2. All API interactions use:
   - Curl commands only (no API clients)
   - JSON files for request data
   - Environment variables for configuration
   - Documentation-first approach

3. Available APIs (user-populated):
   - Ghost CMS
   - Typefully
   - Additional APIs as needed

4. Using `plx-use-api`:
   1. The agent follows a strict documentation hierarchy:
      - First checks `docs.md` in API folder
      - Then checks internal API documentation
      - Finally asks user for documentation if needed
   
   2. Request creation process:
      - Verifies API folder structure
      - Creates/updates `request.json` with proper format
      - Uses curl with environment variables
      - Never builds API clients or libraries

   3. Example structure:
      ```
      apis/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ghost/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs.md
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ request.json
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ typefully/
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs.md
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ request.json
      ```

## üíª PLX Commands

PLX commands in `plx-*.md` files guide specific actions:
- Each command has its own protocol file
- Follow protocol exactly for that part of work
- Stay focused on current task within protocol

## üìù The Agent Work Documents

These documents are maintained by the agent to track work, requirements, and progress:

### your-requirements.md
```markdown
---
document_type: agent work document
goal: getting as clear as possible what needs to be done
gpt_action: use as a reference work to understand exactly what (still) needs to be done and document progress
---

# üë§ Actors & üß© Components (Who or what)
> - Someone or something that can perform actions or be interacted with (examples include User, Button, Screen, Input Field, Message, System, API, Database, and they can be a person, service, visual or non-visual).
> - Possible Parents: Itself
---

- [ ]

# üé¨ Activities (Who or what does what?)
> - Actions that an Actor or Component performs (examples include Create List, Delete Item, Sync Data, and they must always contain a verb + action).
> - Possible Parents: Actors, Components
---

- [ ]

# üåä Activity Flows & Scenarios (What in which order?)
> - Sequences of Atomic Actions (like "Tap button") that map out the steps to complete an Activity. May have optional paths for both successful completion (Happy Flow), errors (Error Flow), and scenarios like no connection, empty states, loading states, etc.
> - Possible Parents: Activities, Itself
---

- [ ]

# üìù Properties (Which values?)
> - Describes a value or configuration that belongs to an object (examples include width, color, id, name).
> - Possible Parents: Actors, Components, Activities, Activity Flows, Scenarios, Atomic Actions, Scenarios, Behaviours
---

- [ ]

# üõ†Ô∏è Behaviours (How does it act when.. in terms of.. ?)
> - Defines how something looks, works and performs Examples include ui/ux, rules & limits, data & analytics, security, performance and scalability.
