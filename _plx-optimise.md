# üîÑ Optimize Content

When you receive this protocol, help optimize file sizes while ensuring critical context is preserved.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis Phase

1. Evaluate Current State
   1. Check file sizes and content density
   2. Identify redundant information
   3. Map critical context and relationships
   4. Note key decision points

2. Optimization Targets
   1. Long conversation summaries
   2. Completed tasks and milestones
   3. Detailed implementation notes
   4. Historical context

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization Strategy

1. Create Versions
   1. Main file (latest + critical context)
   2. Context file (supporting information)
   3. History file (past decisions)

2. Structure Format
   ```markdown
   file.md           # Main file with current state
   file.context.md   # Supporting context and relationships
   file.history.md   # Historical decisions and changes
   ```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Content Management

1. Optimize Main File
   1. Keep latest state
   2. Maintain active items
   3. Include critical context
   4. Link to supporting files

2. Preserve Context
   1. Map relationships
   2. Track dependencies
   3. Link decision points
   4. Reference history

## ‚úÖ Verification
