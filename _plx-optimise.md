# ðŸ”„ Optimize Content

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to optimize file sizes by splitting content while preserving critical context and relationships.

## 1. Analyze Content
[ ] Review current file content and identify optimization opportunities.

Examine file sizes, content density, redundant information, and critical context that must be preserved. This establishes what content can be safely reorganized or moved to supporting files.

## 2. Create Structure
[ ] Set up main file and supporting context files.

Create a main file for current state and active items, a context file for supporting information, and a history file for past decisions. This provides an organized structure for content distribution.

## 3. Distribute Content
[ ] Move content to appropriate files while maintaining relationships.

Carefully split content between main and supporting files, ensuring critical context is preserved through clear links and references. Keep the main file focused while making all information easily accessible.

## 4. Verify Organization
[ ] Confirm all content is properly distributed and linked.

Check that content is appropriately split between files, context is preserved, links are maintained, and navigation remains clear. This ensures the optimization maintains usability while reducing file sizes.

Remember: Focus on making the current state clear while ensuring all context is easily accessible through well-structured supporting files.
