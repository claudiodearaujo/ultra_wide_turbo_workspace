# ðŸ“± Content Collection

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to gather, organize and structure content for social media posts while preserving technical context and learning insights.

## 1. Analyze Input Sources
[ ] Review user input and personal documentation files for content material.

Process user input to identify key topics and requirements, then review your-memory.md, your-requirements.md, and your-todo-list.md to gather technical decisions, implementation details, and milestone achievements that should be included in the content.

## 2. Gather Technical Content
[ ] Document implementation details, code examples, and learning insights.

Collect specific technical information including code snippets, architectural decisions, problem solutions, and key learnings. Note any visual assets needed like screenshots, diagrams or demos to support the technical content.

## 3. Create Content Package
[ ] Add a structured content entry to our-content.md.

Create a new content package in our-content.md using the standard template, including source material, technical details, visual requirements, educational points, and platform-specific content structures for Twitter, LinkedIn and blog posts.

## 4. Document References
[ ] Update your-memory.md with content package details.

Add a reference to the content package in your-memory.md, including links to the content, key technical points covered, relevant context, and any important decisions made during content creation.

Remember:
- Process all user input thoroughly
- Include complete technical context
- Document visual requirements
- Link all references
- Preserve implementation details
