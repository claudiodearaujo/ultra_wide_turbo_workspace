# ⏸️ Pause Work

When you receive this protocol, it means you need to document the current state of work to ensure seamless resumption later.

## 1. Update Work State
[ ] Document current progress and next steps in your files.

Update [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) with timestamp, current task, next steps and decisions, then update [your-todo-list.md](your-todo-list.md) with progress and [your-requirements.md](your-requirements.md) with status changes.

## 2. Create Pause Entry
[ ] Add a detailed pause state entry to your memory file.

Add a timestamped pause entry to [your-memory.md](your-memory.md) that includes current task, next steps, active decisions and any blockers, with links to relevant todo items and requirements.

## 3. Verify Documentation
[ ] Confirm all state information is properly captured.

Review all updates to ensure memory is current, todo status is clear, requirements are updated, and all document links are working correctly.

Remember:
- Only modify files prefixed with "your-"
- Do not create new files
- Do not modify process or protocol files
- Document state in existing files only
